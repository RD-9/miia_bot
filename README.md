# Welcome MiiA Coders
Congratulations on obtaining your MiiA bot.These instructions will take you through everything you need to know on how MiiA bot is put together and what makes her tick. MiiA botis built in the form of a 3D puzzle, so the fun begins immediately. The MiiA design is based off of another great robot called Otto (https://www.ottodiy.com). We have completly open sourced the MiiA bot design under the Creative Commons  license. So without further ado, letâ€™s jump in!

# Assembly
The cad files along with the assembly instructions is found in the assembly folder. This is to help with putting MiiA bot's physical structure together. 
# Getting started
Once the physical robot has been put together, go to the exercise folder to find the getting started guide. This will help you to connect to the Lofi Blocks programming platform and get you started quickly. 
# Exercise sheet
Once MiiA has been connected to the Lofi Blocks platform, the exercise sheets should be worked through.These exercises should be worked through with the video tutorials. This will help you to understand the steps needed when programming MiiA.It will also help you to understand the process of thinking through the problem when creating your own functions.
# Challenge
The final challenge combines all the lessons from the individual exercises. These challenges can be found in the exercise folder.New challenges will be added in order to test your robot skills, so stay tuned.
